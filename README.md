# SemDaX corpora

Sense-annotated corpora from the Semantic Processing Across Domains project. This project pools together the data from several articles related to sense annotation for Danish corpora.

This repository contains three main folders:

1. ```supersenses``` constains the all-words supersense-annotated corpus
1. ```lexicalsample``` constains the lexical-sample annotations for a regular, dictionary based sense inventory, and for a supersense-clustered inventory.
1. ```active_learning``` constains the resulting annotation of "Active Learning for Sense Annotation".



The following publications make use or document the construction of this resource.
